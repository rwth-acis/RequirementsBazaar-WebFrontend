      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Requirements Bazaar is a Web-based tool for continuous innovation through stakeholder participation. It builds
        on the principles of social requirements engineering, which allows communities to express, discuss and
        prioritize their requirements and trace their realization in a way known from social networking.</p>

      <p>On this page, we give you some links to our research and the source.</p>

      <h2>Technical Background</h2>

      <p>Requirements Bazaar consists of a Java-based backend and an HTML5 frontend. The backend is driven by the
        peer-to-peer platform <a href="https://las2peer.org" target="_blank">las2peer</a> which is part of our research.
        The frontend is developed using HTML5 Web Components with the help of the Polymer library.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rwth-acis/RequirementsBazaar" target="_blank">
          https://github.com/rwth-acis/RequirementsBazaar</a>: This repository contains the code for the service
          backend.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rwth-acis/RequirementsBazaar-WebFrontend" target="_blank">
          https://github.com/rwth-acis/RequirementsBazaar-WebFrontend</a>: This repository contains the code for the Web
          frontend, the same that you are using right now.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-ActivityTracker" target="_blank">
          https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-ActivityTracker</a>: This repository contains the code for the Activity
          Tracker backend service that powers the activity tracker.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rwth-acis/activity-tracker" target="_blank">
          https://github.com/rwth-acis/activity-tracker</a>: This repository contains the code for the Activity
          Tracker Web component that asks the service above to fill its content.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rwth-acis/requirements-grid" target="_blank">
          https://github.com/rwth-acis/requirements-grid</a>: Yet another Web component. This one can be embedded on
          3rd-party websites to display a grid of requirements in a specific project and category. You can see an
          example on the <a href="https://wekit-community.org/ideas/" target="_blank">WEKIT Community website</a> where
          new ideas for Augmented Reality tools are collected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Contribute</h2>

      <p>If you are convinced about Requirements Bazaar and want to participate, you are more than welcome! First option
        to add your ideas would be the <a href="https://requirements-bazaar.org/projects/2" target="_blank">Requirements
          Bazaar project</a> here in Requirements Bazaar. ;) You may also help us by issueing a pull request to one of
